# üîß Email Troubleshooting Guide for Afework Pharma Contact Form

## Problem Analysis

Your contact form shows "Message Sent Successfully!" but emails aren't being delivered. This is a common issue with PHP contact forms on shared hosting.

## üéØ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Upload Updated Files to cPanel

Upload these files to your `public_html` directory:

1. **All files from `build/` folder** (your website)
2. **contact-handler.php** (enhanced with debugging)
3. **contact-handler-smtp.php** (SMTP alternative)
4. **test-email.php** (diagnostic tool)

### Step 2: Test Email Configuration

1. **Visit**: `https://afeworkpharmaet.com/test-email.php`
2. **Check the results** - this will show you exactly what's wrong
3. **Take a screenshot** of the results

### Step 3: Try Different Email Methods

#### Option A: Use Enhanced PHP Handler (Default)
- Your contact form is already configured to use `contact-handler.php`
- This version has better error logging and debugging

#### Option B: Use SMTP Handler (Recommended for Production)
Update your contact form to use the SMTP version:

```javascript
// In ContactPage.tsx, change the fetch URL:
const response = await fetch('/contact-handler-smtp.php', {
```

### Step 4: Check Common Issues

#### Issue 1: PHP Mail Function Disabled
**Symptoms**: test-email.php shows "mail() function is NOT available"
**Solution**: Contact your hosting provider to enable PHP mail function

#### Issue 2: SMTP Not Configured
**Symptoms**: Emails send but never arrive
**Solutions**:
- Use the SMTP handler (`contact-handler-smtp.php`)
- Configure SMTP settings in cPanel

#### Issue 3: Spam Filtering
**Symptoms**: Emails go to spam folder
**Solutions**:
- Check spam folders for both business and customer emails
- Configure SPF/DKIM records in cPanel DNS

#### Issue 4: Email Account Issues
**Symptoms**: Authentication failures
**Solutions**:
- Verify `contact@afeworkpharmaet.com` exists and is active
- Test the email account by sending/receiving manual emails
- Check email quota (ensure it's not full)

### Step 5: Configure Email Authentication (Important!)

In cPanel, go to **Email Authentication** and enable:

1. **SPF Record**: Add this TXT record to your DNS:
   ```
   v=spf1 include:afeworkpharmaet.com ~all
   ```

2. **DKIM**: Enable DKIM signing for your domain

3. **DMARC**: Add DMARC policy:
   ```
   v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:contact@afeworkpharmaet.com
   ```

### Step 6: Alternative Solutions

#### If PHP Mail Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Use a Third-Party Service** (like SendGrid, Mailgun):
   ```php
   // Example with SendGrid API
   $curl = curl_init();
   curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
       CURLOPT_URL => 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send',
       CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => json_encode($email_data),
       CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => array(
           'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY',
           'Content-Type: application/json'
       )
   ));
   ```

2. **Use Gmail SMTP** (if allowed by hosting):
   ```php
   $smtp_host = 'smtp.gmail.com';
   $smtp_port = 587;
   $smtp_username = 'your-gmail@gmail.com';
   $smtp_password = 'your-app-password';
   ```

## üö® Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Upload Files
```bash
# Upload these files to public_html:
- All files from build/ folder
- contact-handler.php
- contact-handler-smtp.php  
- test-email.php
```

### 2. Run Diagnostics
Visit: `https://afeworkpharmaet.com/test-email.php`

### 3. Check Email Account
- Log into `contact@afeworkpharmaet.com`
- Send a test email to yourself
- Check if you can receive emails

### 4. Try SMTP Method
If basic PHP mail fails, update your contact form to use:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/contact-handler-smtp.php', {
```

## üìß Expected Results

### When Working Correctly:
1. **Business Email**: Sent to `contact@afeworkpharmaet.com` with customer details
2. **Customer Auto-Reply**: Sent to customer with thank you message
3. **Form Response**: Success message with debug information

### Debug Information:
The enhanced handler now returns debug info:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Thank you! Your message has been sent successfully.",
  "debug": {
    "business_email_sent": true,
    "customer_email_sent": true,
    "mail_function_available": true,
    "to_email": "contact@afeworkpharmaet.com",
    "server_time": "2024-10-11 12:30:00"
  }
}
```

## üîç Debugging Steps

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Check PHP error logs** in cPanel
3. **Test email account** manually
4. **Verify DNS records** for email authentication
5. **Check spam folders** on both ends

## üìû If All Else Fails

Contact your hosting provider with these details:
- "PHP mail() function not working"
- "Need SMTP configuration for contact@afeworkpharmaet.com"
- "Email authentication setup required"

## üóëÔ∏è Cleanup

After troubleshooting, delete these files for security:
- `test-email.php`
- `contact_form_errors.log`

**Next Steps**: Run the diagnostic test and let me know the results!
